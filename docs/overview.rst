Overview
========

Requirements
============

#. PHP 5.5.5 or higher
#. JSON extension
#. XML Support (SimpleXMLElement)
#. By default this library utilizes cURL for communication.
#. To use the cURL client, you must have a recent version of cURL >= 7.19.4
   compiled with OpenSSL and zlib.

.. note::

   If you use the Guzzle client, you do not need to have the cURL extension installed.
   As an alternative, you can enable ``allow_url_fopen`` in your system's php.ini. The included Guzzle version can
   work with the PHP stream wrapper to handle HTTP requests. For more information check out
   `Guzzle's documentation <http://guzzle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html>`_.

.. _installation:

Installation
============

The recommended way to install the PostNL library is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Composer
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install the PostNL library:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require firstred/postnl-api-php:~1.0

You can optionally add Guzzle as a dependency using the composer.phar CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require guzzlehttp/guzzle:~6.3

Alternatively, you can specify Guzzle as a dependency in your project's
existing composer.json file:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "require": {
         "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "~6.3"
      }
   }

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.


Bleeding edge
-------------

During your development, you can keep up with the latest changes on the master
branch by setting the version requirement for this library to ``~1.0@dev``.

.. code-block:: js

   {
      "require": {
         "firstred/postnl-api-php": "~1.0@dev"
      }
   }

Guidelines
----------

1. This library utilizes PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-3, PSR-4, PSR-6 and PSR-7.
2. The library is meant to be lean, fast and sticks to the standards of the REST API. This means
   that not every feature request will be accepted.
3. The PostNL library has a minimum PHP version requirement of PHP 5.5.5. Pull requests must
   not require a PHP version greater than PHP 5.5.5.
4. All pull requests must include unit tests to ensure the change works as
   expected and to prevent regressions.


Running the tests
-----------------

In order to contribute, you'll need to checkout the source from GitHub and
install the dependencies using Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/firstred/postnl-api-php.git
    cd postnl-api-php && curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php && ./composer.phar install --dev

This library is unit tested with PHPUnit. Run the tests using the included PHPUnit version:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tests/
    php ../vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

.. note::

    You'll need to use PHP 5.6 or newer in order to perform
    the tests.
